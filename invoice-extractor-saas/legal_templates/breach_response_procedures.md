## 8. RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

### 8.1 Risk Factors

- Technical data (low risk)

**Number of Affected Individuals:**

- 101-1,000 individuals (high impact)
- 1,000+ individuals (critical impact)

**Likelihood of Harm:**
- Technical safeguards prevent exploitation (low)
- Limited data usefulness to attackers (medium)
- Easily exploitable data exposed (high)
- Data actively being misused (critical)

### 8.2 Risk Matrix
```
LIKELIHOOD vs IMPACT MATRIX

           Low    Medium   High    Critical
Critical   MED    HIGH     HIGH    CRITICAL
High       LOW    MED      HIGH    HIGH
Medium     LOW    LOW      MED     HIGH
Low        LOW    LOW      LOW     MED

Risk Levels:
- LOW: Monitor, no notification required
- MEDIUM: Consider data subject notification
- HIGH: Notify data subjects, consider CNIL
- CRITICAL: Notify CNIL and data subjects
```

### 8.3 Notification Decision Tree
1. **Is this a personal data breach?** → If No: Security incident procedures
2. **Is there risk to rights and freedoms?** → If No: Document only
3. **Can we notify CNIL within 72 hours?** → If No: Submit with delay explanation
4. **Is there high risk to data subjects?** → If Yes: Notify data subjects
5. **Are there exemptions applicable?** → Apply Article 34(3) exemptions if relevant
